# Forecasting_Predicting-Airlines-Passengers-Numbers

Forecast theAirlines Passengers Numbers from it's data set. Prepare a document for each model explaining how many dummy variables you have created and RMSE value for each model. Finally which model you will use for Forecasting.

# Forecasting

Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.

## Forecasting methods:-

1)	If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then qualitative forecasting methods must be used.
2)	Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:\
      a)	numerical information about the past is available\
      b)	it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
      
## Forecasting model building methods:-
1)	Linear model
2)	Exponential model
3)	Quadratic model
4)	Additive seasonality 
5)	Additive seasonality with quadratic trend	
6)	Multiplicative Seasonality


## Data Used :

              Airlines dataset :- Forecast the passengers in the airlines depending on past and present data
              
## Programming:- 
                  Python



**The Codes regarding  Forecasting *to Forecast the passenger numbers in the airlines with airlines dataset* is present in this Repository in detail.**
